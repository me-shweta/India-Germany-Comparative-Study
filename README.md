## Some Dataset Columns
- **Male Mortality before Age 60**: Deaths under age 60 per 1,000 male live births.
- **Female Mortality before Age 60**: Deaths under age 60 per 1,000 female live births.
- **Mortality between Age 15 and 50, both sexes**: Deaths under age 50 per 1,000 alive at age 15.
- **Male Mortality between Age 15 and 50**: Deaths under age 50 per 1,000 males alive at age 15.
- **Female Mortality between Age 15 and 50**: Deaths under age 50 per 1,000 females alive at age 15.
- **Mortality between Age 15 and 60, both sexes**: Deaths under age 60 per 1,000 alive at age 15.
- **Male Mortality between Age 15 and 60**: Deaths under age 60 per 1,000 males alive at age 15.

## Conclusion
By analyzing socio-demographic trends, this project provides insights into the differences and similarities between India and Germany. This analysis can be valuable for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in demographic trends.
